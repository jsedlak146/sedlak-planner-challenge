## Description

This homework challenge had us updating an existing planner with dynamic HTML CSS and Javascript.  The goal was to have a planner that tracked the day, time of day. adjusted the colors of the time blocks accordingly and saved our inputs into local storage. Below are my URLs for my repository and live pages site:

## Installation

For this homework, I started by defining the variables that I would need in my Javascript.  These would allow me to then build in the functionality for my planner.  Next I added a function that allowed the current date to be displayed at the top of the page, and keep refereence to the hour of the day. Next I did the function for changing the color of the time slots based on past, present, or future. Finally, I set up the local storage and my save button.

## Usage

To use the planner, refresh the page.  The past timeblocks will be shown in grey, oresent blocks in red and future blocks in green.  Simply choose the time block you want to enter an event in, then type in your event and click the save button!
